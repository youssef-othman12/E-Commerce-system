#**about my E-Commerce-system**
An simple e-commerce system using oop method 

I uses 8 classes for this project 
the super class **product** and sub classes **BookProduct**/**ClothingProduct**/**ElectronicProduct**

**Customer** which have customer info

**cart**  the methods in this class is addProduct/calculatePrice/placeOrder

Each of the previous classes have setters and getters 
note* sometimes i used constructor instead of setters

**Order** this class prints order info for the user

**EcommerceSystem** This class serves as the entry point for the project. It contains the main method 
and demonstrates the usage of the other classes.
